uWaterloo LaTeX work report template adhering to the SYDE style guide.

To render/compile the LaTeX you can either follow the various compilation steps, (i.e. running pdflatex multiple times), or use a tool like TexWorks, which does it for you.

If you don't have spell-checking as an os-feature, I have had success with Excalibur.

Hey? Where's the template!?

I started from a template once, then I just found it easier to rip out the innards of this report every time I needed a new one. If you want to submit a template (ideally with a working bibtex database) I will accept pull requests.
