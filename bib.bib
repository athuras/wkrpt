abstract ={There has been considerable interest in the last ten years or so in methods of generating sequences of arrangements of n elements in such a way that each of the n! arrangements is generated once, and only once, in the sequence. We call such sequences of arrangements permutation sequences. In part 1 we consider several kinds of permutation sequences and describe some of their properties. Part 2 is devoted to a detailed examination of the practically most efficient six published algorithms and a discussion of implementation difficulties and compiler overheads. An Appendix to Part 2 contains an extensive bibliography of related work.},
